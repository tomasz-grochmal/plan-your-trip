# Introduction

# How to start

**Note** that this seed project requires node v4.x.x or higher and npm 2.14.7.

**Here is how to [speedup the build on Windows](https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-seed/wiki/Speedup-the-build-on-Windows)**.

In order to start the seed use:


```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-seed.git
cd angular2-seed
# install the project's dependencies
npm install
# watches your files and uses livereload by default
npm start
# api document for the app
npm run docs

# dev build
npm run build.dev
# prod build
npm run build.prod
```

_Does not rely on any global dependencies._

# Configuration

Default application server configuration

```javascript
var PORT             = 5555;
var LIVE_RELOAD_PORT = 4002;
var DOCS_PORT        = 4003;
var APP_BASE         = '/';
```

Configure at runtime

```bash
npm start -- --port 8080 --reload-port 4000 --base /my-app/
```

# How to extend?

Visit the [Wiki page](https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-seed/wiki) of the project.

# Running tests

```bash
npm test

# Debug - In two different shell windows
npm run build.test.watch      # 1st window
npm run karma.start           # 2nd window

# code coverage (istanbul)
# auto-generated at the end of `npm test`
# view coverage report:
npm run serve.coverage

# e2e (aka. end-to-end, integration) - In three different shell windows
# Make sure you don't have a global instance of Protractor

# npm run webdriver-update <- You will need to run this the first time
npm run webdriver-start
npm run serve.e2e
npm run e2e

# e2e live mode - Protractor interactive mode
# Instead of last command above, you can use:
npm run e2e.live
```
You can learn more about [Protractor Interactive Mode here](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/debugging.md#testing-out-protractor-interactively)

# Advanced Seed Option

An [advanced option to this seed exists here](https://github.com/NathanWalker/angular2-seed-advanced) which mirrors the latest changes here but adds core support for:

- [ngrx/store](https://github.com/ngrx/store) RxJS powered state management, inspired by **Redux**
- [ngrx-store-router](https://github.com/CodeSequence/ngrx-store-router) middleware for syncing state with Angular 2 Router.
- [ng2-translate](https://github.com/ocombe/ng2-translate) for i18n
- [lodash](https://lodash.com/) Helps reduce blocks of code down to single lines and enhances readability
- [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/) cross platform mobile (w/ native UI) apps.
- More coming in the future...

You may use it to learn how to extend this seed for your own use cases or use the advanced seed if your project needs those features.
